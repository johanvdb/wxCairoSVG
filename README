wxCairoSVG library

A wxWidgets library to generate bitmaps from SVG images using the cairo library

This project contains the code that makes use of the cross platform cairo library to interpret SVG images and produce raster wxImage equivalents.

It is still very much in its infancy.

The code is hosted at https://github.com/johanvdb/wxCairoSVG
